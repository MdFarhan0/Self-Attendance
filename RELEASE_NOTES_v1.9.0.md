#### 📅 Calendar-First Approach
Unlike traditional attendance trackers, Self Attendance lets you mark attendance on specific dates, giving you a complete historical view.

#### 🎯 Smart Insights
The app tells you exactly:
- "You can bunk X more classes and still stay above 75%"
- "Attend the next X classes to reach 75%"
- "You're just safe at 75%. Don't miss the next class"

#### 📊 Attendance Control Sidebar
Tap the rotating gear icon on the home screen to see smart attendance messages for all your subjects at once.

### What Makes This Unique?

**No other app in the market** combines:
- ✅ Calendar visualization
- ✅ Date-specific attendance records
- ✅ AI-powered bunk allowance calculations
- ✅ Visual attendance patterns and streaks

Most attendance apps just show percentages. **Self Attendance shows you the complete picture.**
